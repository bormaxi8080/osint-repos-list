# OSINT Repos List, Repository with gathered from GitHub utilities for OSINT, Development and DevOps. The number of artifacts in the repository exceeded 3200

## OSINT Repos List — Why This Dataset Exists

Most OSINT and investigative work eventually runs into the same problem:
tools accumulate faster than they can be meaningfully documented.

Bookmarks grow.
Starred repositories multiply.
Links are saved “for later” — and quietly forgotten.

Over time, it becomes increasingly difficult to answer simple questions:
Which tools are actually used?
Which repositories are actively maintained?
Which utilities are practical, and which are merely theoretical?

**OSINT Repos List** exists as an attempt to address this problem.

### What this dataset is

OSINT Repos List is a structured dataset built from an actively used working environment.
It documents open-source repositories related to:

- OSINT and open-source investigations,
- data collection and analysis,
- software development and automation,
- DevOps and infrastructure tooling,
- information security and research utilities.

The dataset is not a curated “top tools” list and not a recommendation catalog.
It reflects what is actually being used, tested, evaluated and maintained over time.

### Why this approach matters

Traditional OSINT lists tend to be static.
They age quickly, lose context and fail to reflect real-world usage.

This dataset is different in several ways:

- it grows automatically,
- it preserves metadata such as update activity and popularity,
- it reflects a long-term working toolchain rather than a one-time selection,
- it allows patterns and trends to emerge naturally.

Instead of asking “what tools should I use?”, the dataset helps answer:
“What tools are people actually using in practice?”

### What kind of information it contains

Each entry in the dataset includes:

- repository name and owner,
- short description,
- associated topics and tags,
- popularity indicators,
- update timestamps.

This makes it possible to explore the dataset not only as a list of tools,
but also as a reference for understanding how the open-source OSINT ecosystem evolves.

### Example entries

Below are several illustrative examples taken from the dataset.

[INSERT SCREENSHOT — Example repository A]

[INSERT SCREENSHOT — Example repository B]

[INSERT SCREENSHOT — Example repository C]

These examples demonstrate the diversity of tooling represented in the dataset,
ranging from general-purpose utilities to highly specialized niche projects.

### Intended use

OSINT Repos List is designed for:

- investigators and researchers,
- journalists and analysts,
- engineers and automation specialists,
- information security practitioners.

It can be used as:

- a discovery aid,
- a reference archive,
- a way to cross-check tooling choices,
- a snapshot of a working OSINT environment at a given point in time.
