# OSINT Repos List — Dataset Update

Over time, any serious OSINT, investigative or engineering workflow accumulates tools.
Not as theoretical recommendations, but as a living, evolving toolset shaped by real usage.

**OSINT Repos List** is a continuously growing repository of GitHub projects related to OSINT, software development, DevOps and information security.

This is not a random collection of starred links.
The repository reflects a long-term working toolchain accumulated through real investigative, analytical and engineering tasks.

As of today, the number of collected artifacts has exceeded **[INSERT TOTAL COUNT] repositories**, and the list continues to grow automatically.

This post documents the current state of the dataset, explains how it is structured, and outlines how it can be used in practice.

## What this repository actually contains

The OSINT Repos List catalogs GitHub repositories and their owners used in OSINT, development, DevOps and security-related workflows.

Each entry in the dataset includes:

- repository name and owner,
- short description,
- associated topics and tags,
- popularity indicators (stars),
- last update timestamps.

The dataset reflects the current state of an actively used working environment rather than a manually curated showcase or promotional list.

**Dataset parameters (current update):**

- Total starred repositories: **[INSERT NUMBER]**
- Generation date: **[INSERT DATE]**

## How the dataset is generated

The list is generated automatically from GitHub metadata.

This approach ensures:

- reproducibility,
- minimal manual bias,
- consistent update timestamps,
- scalability beyond what is realistically maintainable by hand.

The repository serves as a technical snapshot of a working OSINT and engineering toolchain at a given point in time.

## How this dataset can be used

Typical practical use cases include:

- discovering OSINT tools by category,
- building internal investigative or research toolkits,
- cross-checking commonly used open-source utilities,
- analyzing tooling trends over time,
- sourcing reliable open-source references for reports, audits and research,
- maintaining an offline reference archive.

The dataset is intended for professionals who require structured access to tooling rather than ad-hoc link collections.
